# Mesh Heal add-on for Blender

## Introduction

Mesh Heal is an add-on for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). It
includes additional Blender operators for healing surface meshes. By
default, Blender contains many routines that are meant for these
tasks, e.g. tools in the *3D-Print Toolbox* add-on.
Unfortunately, Blender’s default routines don’t always produce
good results in some difficult cases. Specifically, I run into
problems when I was trying to convert non-manifold isosurfaces into
manifold surfaces with consistent face normals appropriate for
volumetric rendering.

Add-on was last tested with Blender LTS 3.6.
